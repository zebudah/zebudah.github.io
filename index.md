#### Horses part 1   5/28/19

Today I am going to talk about horses.You would think that I was just going to my  favorite ice cream shop, thinking how good the ice cream is when I see or should I say my sister said she saw a friend.Now this friend happened to be a farmer.Not just a farmer,a horse farmer.When my sister starts talking about horses,you’re stuck there for a hour.But luckily, we were only there for fifteen minutes.We ended up driving up their driveway.  
	Next thing I know,I was looking at my hope to be future horse.he was great!He’s fifteen,one person said.I didn’t want to leave but I knew I had to.The rest of the ride home,I was daydreaming about that horse.he was perfect just how calm he was I liked.Here I am writing about this and I can’t wait to get him,that is if I am getting him.  
	Now, I have been waiting for a horse for a long time so I am pretty excited  to get one.My sister knows a ton about horses so I’ve been around horses most of my life.So because of that I’ve always wanted a horse.  
	Actually,I was going to get four ponies just a couple of days ago.Well, I might still get them.we just haven’t heard back from them.It all started with me and my sister looking for horses.Then We saw them.Four ponies.We decided to call,and guess what they said that we could get them!Because of that,for the next weekend I was overjoyed so I couldn’t think straight.Couple of days later and no call.We gave up.and started looking for more horses.Then,we found the thoroughbred. write more about this story later. 
I'm so excited about writing my first blog and I will start write some more storys.By Z

####  Horses part 2  5/29/19

Now it's the time evreyone has been waiting for.The throughtbred was just waiting on the website.It was the same day as the ponies but as you know that didn't work.As soon as I saw the throughtbred,I knew it wasn't the right horse for me but I stil thought I should contact my sister about this thoughtbred.We tryed and tryed but they were busy.I wanted to try at least one more time.But even though it was a half hour later I was sure that they would pick up.three.two.one.
I will leave one more cliff hanger,

#### Short Story   5/28/19

Hi I know it’s soon to write but I have to much time on my hands.Which is mostly because school is almost out.yay!Now this is not as much a story as it is just something to just write about.Now just warning you that this is going to be a short story if you can really call it that.Now if you have seen my subtitle then you will know that it says,An Owl for your Thoughts.If you’re curious than might of thought what that meant,and now I’m going to explain that to you now.I don’t know how and why but I really like owls. Their my favorite animal.  
I will try to write daliy but with school it might be hard.But like today I might post more then daliy.
